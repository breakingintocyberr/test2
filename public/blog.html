            <h1>My First Blog Post</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, I got the server running. Feels amazing, but I know there's a ton of stuff I still want to do. I plan on really decking out this page. I'm thinking, 'frutiger aero!'</p>

            <p>So it's been a little while since I've been able to work on this site. I have a whole lot going on in my life, different pieces which I'm trying to all move at once. I recently went on a trip to Germany to see Deftones [my favourite band of all time] play live. I am a little obsessed with them right now, just ask my girlfriend how annoying I am about it. This is a long term project for me, so expect a lot more soon. I plan to add some pictures/videos of the trip here soon!</p>
